GETTING STARTED
===============
Use git to clone the repo from GitHub.

`git clone git@github.com:aarikpokras/spectacleos.git`

Say you cloned the repo to your desktop folder. So, before you enter the spectacleOS directory, run `chmod -R 755 spectacleos`.

Enter the spectacleOS directory.

To build, run `./first-time`. It'll ask you for the path to the spectacleOS directory. You can drag the folder into the terminal window.
(If your sysadmin blocks the terminal for some reason, you can download iTerm. It's good.)

Download iTerm2: https://iterm2.com/downloads.html

First, make sure the executables aren't corrupt:

`./specs && ./specs -h`

Then, you can start spectacleOS: `./specs start`

Tutorial: `./specs --tutorial`

CHECKING FOR UPDATES
====================
You can run `./specs --updates` to check for updates.

PYTHON3
=======
You probably noticed by now that Python 3 is kind of required to run spectacleOS. You can modify the code or get the Python 2.7 version on the branch py2.7. (It won't be very up to date)

Installing Python 3
-------------------
`sudo apt install python3`
`sudo yay -S python3`
`brew install python3`
etc.
