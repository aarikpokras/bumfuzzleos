**Please read this:** when you sign in as a spectacleOS user, it may ask for your password with the little key icon. <img src="https://i.ibb.co/GdJtLvv/image.png" width="9">This is *not* your spectacleOS password. It is the password you log in to your computer with. You may notice (if you're observant and have quick eyes) that the word "maskpass" appears on your screen repeatedly when you run spectacleOS. This is ***not*** to steal your *real* password, but to mask your spectacleOS password when you type it in. In summary, when you see the little <img src="https://i.ibb.co/GdJtLvv/image.png" width="9"> icon, it is to give read-and-write permissions to the **spectacleOS user's password file**. Not yours. The password file is located in this path inside the `spectacleos` folder. `home/[username]/pw`. When you see this, please enter *your* login password.

**PLEASE do not change the folder name. A lot of programs in the folder are highly based on it.**
