## Installation
You can get the latest release [here](https://github.com/aarikpokras/spectacleos/releases), or [use git](https://github.com/aarikpokras/spectacleos#macos) to get the zip from GitHub.

Spectacle is available for all UNIX-like operating systems that can support Python.
**It is recommended to grab the latest release from the releases page (Rather than using git), because those will be the most up-to-date. [Learn More](nocurl.md)**

### MacOS
To install Python, run `brew install python3`. I know brew is *really* slow (if you haven't updated it in a while), but unless you know a better way to get Python, it's the only way.

You can use git to download the repo. Depending on your internet speed, it might download painfully slowly. Sorry 'bout that.

```console
git clone git@github.com:aarikpokras/spectacleos.git
```
### Linux and Others
To install Python, you can use `apt` or your standard package manager.

`sudo apt install python3`, `sudo yay -S python3`, `sudo yum -S python3`, etc.

```console
git clone git@github.com:aarikpokras/spectacleos.git
```
